# FreeRCT build instructions #

Currently only Linux is officially supported, but Windows support should be possible with a few minor modifications. See [BuildProgramVisualStudio](BuildProgramVisualStudio.md) for instructions on building FreeRCT on Windows using Visual Studio.

## Package building ##
  * For building native _Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint_ packages, the repository has a 'debian' subdirectory with a build description. There is also an _**unofficial**_ PPA at https://launchpad.net/~adrian-arroyocalle/+archive/freerct, set up by Adri√°n Arroyo Calle.

## Check out ##

The source code is in Subversion, so you need a svn client to get it.

The command to do this is
<pre>
$ svn checkout http://freerct.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/   freerct-read-only<br>
</pre>
(see also the 'source' tab of the project)

## Building the program ##

Almost everything is written in C++, which means you need **g++** or **clang++** to compile it. FreeRCT uses C++11 features, so g++ 4.8+ or clang 3.3+ is recommended.
In addition, you need:

  * **libpng** - Making the RCD data files that contain the graphics and other data read by the program.
  * **SDL2** & **SDL2\_ttf** - Displaying graphics of the program. Note that SDL2 versions of the libraries are required.
  * **CMake>=2.8** & **make** - Building the program.
  * `[optional]` **lex/flex** - Scanner generator for generating RCD input files.
  * `[optional]` **yacc/bison** - Parser generator for generating RCD input files.

The existence of these programs/libraries is checked by `cmake`.

Building is as simple as

<pre>
$ cd freerct-read-only # Go into the downloaded source directory.<br>
$ cmake .              # Checks libraries are where they're supposed to be and replaces some strings<br>
$ make                 # Let make do the heavy work.<br>
</pre>

  * _src_ directory contains the source code of the FreeRCT program itself.
  * _src/rcdgen_ directory contains the source code of the _rcdgen_ program, that builds RCD files from source (which are read by _freerct_).
  * _graphics/rcd_ directory contains the source files of the RCD data files, except the graphics.
  * _graphics/sprites_ directory contains all the graphics of the game.

The _cmake/make_ commands above will generate the _rcdgen_ program, the rcd files and build the 'freerct' program in the src directory.

## Config file ##

Finally, you need a 'freerct.cfg' INI format file next to the 'freerct' program, containing the path to the font file you want to use. It looks like

```
[font]
medium-size = 12
medium-path = /usr/share/fonts/gnu-free/FreeSans.ttf
```

This means the medium sized font is 12 points high, and its source font definition file is at the indicated path. Make sure you use a path that actually exists.

The actual file is not that critical, as long as it contains the ASCII characters, in the font-size you mention in the file.

## Running the program ##

Now run the program

<pre>
$ cd src<br>
$ ./freerct<br>
</pre>

or

<pre>
$ make run<br>
</pre>

which should open a window containing a piece of greenly coloured flat world, and a toolbar near the left top (see also the pictures in the blog).

Pressing 'q' quits the program.
