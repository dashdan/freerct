# Introduction #

To make the windows consistent, some general design rules are laid out here.



# Colours #
Although each widget has a colour, a window should have a single colour as much as possible to give a clean and placid look.

The colour of a window depends on its function:

| **Type of window** | **Colour** |
|:-------------------|:-----------|
| Construction | Brown |
| Warning | Red |
| Landscaping | Green |
| Ride/guest info | Dark red |
