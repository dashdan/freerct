There are four types of staff:
  * Handyman
  * Engineer
  * Security guard
  * Entertainer


Handymen have the following roles:
  * Scrubbing paths to remove vomit and litter (messy paths reduce guest happiness)
  * Maintaining scenery objects which require maintenance (e.g. flower beds require watering)
  * Emptying bins (to prevent overflowing)
  * Maintaining terrain which requires maintenance (e.g. mowing grass)

Security guards have one role:
  * Patrolling paths (when a security guard is nearby an angry guest is less likely to vandalise)

Entertainers have one role:
  * Patrolling paths and dancing/entertaining guests (increases happiness)

Engineers have two roles:
  * Called to rides at the specified maintenance interval (regular servicing reduces loss of reliability over time)
  * Called to rides in the case of a breakdown (rides cannot run while broken down, some breakdowns may cause accidents)
  * (Fixing vandalised path decorations and scenery?)

All staff (except handymen while mowing grass) stay on the paths and ignore queues. Patrol areas can be defined per staff member; in this case the staff member does not leave the specified area and will attempt to return to it if removed.

All staff (like guests) can be picked up and placed in a new location on the map.
