The primary roles of scenery are to improve guest happiness and to increase the excitingness of rides.

Scenery types:
  * Single tile objects
  * Multiple tile objects
  * Quarter tile objects
  * Fences
  * Path decorations

These can be subcategorised by type:
  * Objects
  * Trees and flowers

Some scenery items have specific functionality, for example the over-path sign which is placed on paths. This can be used to close that section of path to guests. Some scenery has specific requirements, for example flower beds which have to be watered by a handyman else the plants will gradually die.

Different terrain and support types are a related feature. All land tiles can be given one of several ground types, rocks, grass, sand, etc., and foundation type, bare, wood, rock, etc.  Similarly different path types are available. Some ground types have special maintenance requirements, like grass which requires mowing by a handyman to stay in a format pleasing to guests.

Some path decorations have key functions:

  * Benches - guests can sit and gradually restore energy. Guests also prefer to sit while eating.
  * Bins - some guest items produced litter when consumed, eg. drinks, food. Guests would dispose of litter in bins (which had to be emptied by handymen) or would litter the path.

In addition the world features weather. Weather can be sunny, cloudy, light or heavy rain or stormy. Weather is season dependent (the time in the park runs March to October and back to March seamlessly) and impactes guest behaviour. Outdoor rides are less popular in bad, especially wet, weather. Good weather boosted guest happiness and makes guests seek water rides.
