Guests can buy, carry and use/consume several types of item. These are:
  * Food (Chips, pizza, candy floss/cotton candy, burgers etc. These items reduce guest hunger, increase energy (and increase nausea?) as they are eaten.)
  * Drinks (Fizzy drinks, water, etc. These reduce thirst (and increase energy?) as they are consumed.)
  * Balloons (No functional effect)
  * On-ride photos (No functional effect)
  * Umbrella (Used when raining. Umbrellas reduce loss of happiness during rainy weather and negate the aversion to queues during rain. 'Outdoor' rides, which are less popular during rain, are not affected by umbrellas.)
  * Park maps (These reduce the chance of guests getting lost and help guests find rides which match their preferences.)
  * Litter (Generated when some items are used up, must be disposed of in a bin or it is eventually dropped)

## Graphics ##
Sprites for the different items will be overlaid onto the 'guest carrying something' sprites. For simplicity only one item will be shown at a time, eg. if a guest with a balloon and an umbrella buys a drink then just the drinks can would be shown. Once finished with the drink the balloon would be shown. If, at any point, it started raining then the umbrella would be shown.

Some item types require specialised animations:
  * Food & drink; sipping/biting animation
  * Map; looking at map animation
