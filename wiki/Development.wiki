= Development =

Development has just started, and thus there is not much to see yet.
Globally, three things are being developed in this project:

  # Graphics for everything. People, paths, gui sprites, and of course the rides and coasters.
  # A format to package the graphics and their properties (size, weight, cost, etc) into files. These files are called RCD files (Roller Coaster Data files).
  # A program that loads the RCD files, and allows them to be used in the game.

== Building the program ==

The BuildProgram page explains how to build the program and data files yourself from the source.

== Other pages ==

  * CommitStyle The format used for the commit messages.
  * ProgramContentAndBehaviour Pages about what the program contains, and how they interact with each other (once it is implemented).
