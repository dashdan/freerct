Development has just started, and thus there is not much to see yet.
Globally, three things are being developed in this project:

  # Graphics for everything. People, paths, gui sprites, and of course the rides and coasters.
  # A format to package the graphics and their properties (size, weight, cost, etc) into files. These files are called RCD files (Roller Coaster Data files).
  # A program that loads the RCD files, and allows them to be used in the game.
