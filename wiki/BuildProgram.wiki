#summary Build instructions

= FreeRCT build instructions =

Sorry, only instructions for Linux. I have nothing against Windows, but I don't have such a system, nor did I ever used it for any serious development, so I cannot tell you how to do things there.

== Check out ==

The source code is in Subversion, so you need a svn client to get it.

The command to do this is
<pre>
$ svn checkout http://freerct.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/   freerct-read-only
</pre>
(see also the 'source' tab of the project)

== Building RCD files ==

The RCD files contain the data/graphics of the program.

To build them, you need Python 2.7 and the Python-imaging library (PIL). Many linuces have them in their package manager.

Building is as simple as

<pre>
$ cd freerct-read-only # Go into the downloaded source directory.
$ cd rcd               # Go into the 'rcd' directory.
$ make                 # Let make do the heavy work.
$ cd ..                # Go back to the root
</pre>

== Building the program ==

The program is written in C++, which means you need g++ to compile it.
In addition, you need the development packages of SDL and SDL-ttf (true-type font). It uses Python again to generate a table/strings.h file in the process.

The paths where it looks for SDL are hard-coded in the Makefile. (No pretty ./configure yet).

<pre>
$ cd src  # Go into the source code directory.
$ make    # Build it.
</pre>

This should create a 'freerct' program in the directory.

== Config file ==

Finally, you need a 'freerct.cfg' INI format file next to the 'freerct' program, containing the path to the font file you want to use. It looks like

{{{
[font]
medium-size = 12
medium-path = /usr/share/fonts/gnu-free/FreeSans.ttf
}}}

This means the medium sized font is 12 points high, and its source font definition file is at the indicated path. Make sure you use a path that actually exists.

The actual file is not that critical, as long as it contains the ASCII characters, in the font-size you mention in the file.

== Running the program ==

Now run the program

<pre>
$ ./freerct
</pre>

which should open a window containing a piece of greenly coloured flat world, and a toolbar near the left top (see also the pictures in the blog).

Pressing 'q' quits the program.
